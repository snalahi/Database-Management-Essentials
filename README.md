# Database-Management-Essentials
#### There are three essential characteristics that are important for business databases:
#### Persistency
#### Inter-related
#### Databases are shared with many applications using the database, and many users simultaneously interacting with the database.

Nonprocedural access to a database allows a user to submit queries to a database without having to know how the data will be retrieved. Extensive coding is not required to access the data. For instance, SQL's SELECT statement.

Non-procedural database access is a crucial feature of a DBMS. Non procedural-database access reduces coding requirements related to data retrieval by a hundred times, giving a large boost for software development and productivity.

DBMSs support non-procedural access through the database language SQL, graphical tools or query development, form and report development tools, and interfaces in computer programming languages. 

A procedural language interface adds the full capabilities of a computer programming language.

#### Data Warehouse 
A term coined by William Inmon in 1990, refers to a logically centralized data repository where data from operational databases and other sources are integrated, cleaned and standardized to support business intelligence.

#### 4th Generation DBMS is often referred to as Object Oriented or NoSQL DBMS which eventually implies to the arena of Big Data.

#### NoSQL => Not only SQL

#### NoSQL Databases (aka "not only SQL") 
Are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

#### Data Modeling
Is the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures. The goal is to illustrate the types of data used and stored within the system, the relationships among these data types, the ways the data can be grouped and organized and its formats and attributes.

#### Types of data modeling
- Hierarchical data models 
- Relational data models
- Entity-relationship (ER) data models
- Object-oriented data models
- Dimensional data models

One table's Primary Key is another table's Foreign Key.

In Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) => A solid line means that the foreign key cannot have missing values. A dash line means that the foreign key can accept missing or null values. 

VARCHAR() => implies to varying length of characters.

CHAR() => implies to fixed length of characters.

An integrity constraint must be placed external when it is involved with or it considers multiple columns.
